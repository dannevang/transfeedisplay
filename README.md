# Transaction Card Fee Display

This is a simple Magento extension that displays the card fee made from orders where the customer used the epay payment module (https://github.com/ePay/magento) and displays it as a separate line in the orders total.

Works on the order confirmation, invoice and credit memo.

It should work with other versions as well, but it havenâ€™t been tested.

## Installation
